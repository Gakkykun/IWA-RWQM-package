# IWA River Water Quality Model No.1 simulation and sensitivity and identifiability analyses

This repository contains Fortran and Python programs to replicate the work presented in Inagaki et al., which was submitted to Water Practice & Technology (IWA Publishing) and currently under review. They were tested in Ubuntu 20.04 (They would be run without issues on a Windows machine as well). If you face issues to run the code, please email me. 

## Usage of Python

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `conda conda env create -f environmnet.yml` 
3. Run `conda activate iwa-simulation`
4. Install an additional library called "SciencePlots" developed by John D. Garrett (see more details at https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots), running `pip install git+https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots` Please make sure that you installed Latex in advance, otherwise you will get an error. Alternatively, you can comment out code related to this library.

## Building a Fortran program and display results
### Compare observed and modeled flow velocties
 - Move to the "output-flow" floder with `cd output-flow` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`
 - Run `python linearRegression.py`

### Calibrate flow-related parameters
 - Move to the "calibration-flow" floder with `cd calibration-flow` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`

### Run water quality simulation and display results
 - Move to the "output" floder with `cd output` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`
 - Give either 1, 2, or 3 as an comand line argument such as `python plot-compiled.py 1`, which means a data set number was set to 1. Created png files will be stored in the `png-compiled` folder.
 - Give either 1, 2, or 3 as an comand line argument such as `python plot.py 1`, which means a data set number was set to 1. Created png files will be stored in the `png` folder.

### Calibrate kinetic parameters
 - Move to the "calibration-kinetic" floder with `cd calibration-kinetic` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`

### Analyze sensitivities of kinetic parameters 
 - Move to the "sensitivity-kinetic" floder with `cd sensitivity-kinetic` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`
 - Give either 1, 2, or 3 as an comand line argument such as `python sensitivity-test-kinetic.py 1`, which means a data set number was set to 1.

### Analyze sensitivities of water quality of Jyokaso
 - Move to the "sensitivity-WQ" floder with `cd sensitivity-WQ` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`
 - Give either 1, 2, or 3 as an comand line argument such as `python sensitivity-test-WQ.py 1`, which means a data set number was set to 1.

### Scenario analysis
 - Move to the "scenario" floder with `cd scenario` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `make cleanall`
 - Run `make all`
 - Run `./main`
 - Run `jupyter lab`
 - Select `plot-compare.ipynb` in a launched web browser, and run all of cells.


### Statistical analysis
 - Move to the "python-data-processing" floder with `cd python-data-processing` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `python stats-analysis.py`

### Parallel coordinate
 - Move to the "python-data-processing" floder with `cd python-data-processing` if you are in `IWA-RWQM-package`
 - Run `python parallel-coordinates.py` and then two png files will be created
